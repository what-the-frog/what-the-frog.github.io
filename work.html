							As a bioinformatician working for the Austrian Institute of Technology my job was to create an automatic workflow to analyze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulating_tumor_DNA" target="_blank">circulating tumor DNA</a> experiments.
							I was part of a project trying to determine if ctDNA from saliva would yield similar results as DNA extracted from blood in breast cancer patients. <br>
							This project was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept" target="_blank">proof of concept</a> and the topic of my master's thesis.
							<br>
							The automatic workflow was created using R which is a staple in statistics and bioinformatics. 
							The aim of the workflow was to use the output of specific instruments and analyze them without having to manually process the enormous amount of data.<br>
							The workflow provided not only (statistical) test results but also visualized them.

							<span class="statement">2018 - Bioinformatician</span><br>
							Having previously worked in the bioinformatics department of the Austrian Institute of Technology, I was asked to return and work on a software to help scientists (and bioinformaticians) plan laboratory experiments.
							The idea was to standardize the process as every scientist had their own system that was difficult to transfer between projects and individuals. <br>
							<br>
							The software was accomplished as a web app using Django, jQuery, JavaScript and HTML5. 
							It accepted a variety of inputs (eg. copy & paste from Microsoft Excel), could be used to plan experiments manually and resulted in downloadable spreadsheets.<br>
							This software was designed for in-house use and was later sold to different businesses.

							Having experience in Django, Python and Frontend Technologies, I started working for 
							<a href="https://www.t3k.ai/" target="_blank">T3K Forensics</a> and was mainly in charge of creating the GUI for their flagship product 
							Law Enforcement Analysis Platform - <a href="https://www.t3k.ai/leap" target="_blank">LEAP</a>.
							<br>
							The GUI was transformed from a basic HTML frontend to a modern Django based Web App used by Law Enforcement all over the world.

							In 2022 LEAP's toolkit was expanded and released for the German Bundespolizei under the name AIRA (AI-Enabled Rapid Assessment of CSAM). It is used to quickly find CSAM if it exists on the analyzed device.
							While I was still responsible for the GUI of LEAP/AIRA, I also worked on the heart of the App written in Python 3.
							<br><br>
							In May 2023 the German Television Program RTL showed AIRA and its use in their program Punkt 6.

							While LEAP was already the flagship product, the design and underlying technology has aged over time. I was given the task to rewrite the GUI in a more modern design. 
							Alongside this project, the maintenance and improvement of LEAP version 2 was also my responsibility. <br>
							
							LEAP version 3, which is currently still in development, is based on a React & Tailwind combination.
